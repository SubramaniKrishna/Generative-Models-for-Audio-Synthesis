Potential Interesting Regions in Music Synthesis - 
	1. Physical Modelling Synthesis - 
		; You are modelling the dynamics of the underlying system that generates the waveform.
		; Lot more freedom in controlling the generating parameters(modify the governing differential equation itself)
		; Digital Waveguide Synthesis
	2. Stochastic Modelling Synthesis - 
		; Model based on spectrum(short time) of the sound
		; (sine + noise + transients)
		; Effects(Processing)
		; Perceptually closer to ear(Harmonic Analyzer)
