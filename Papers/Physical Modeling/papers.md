# Papers
The following is the list of papers. The bold one is the one which I have briefly gone through, and would recommend as a guide for Physical Modeling in general.
1. **Physical Modeling using Digital Waveguides** - Prof. Julius Smith's original paper on waveguide synthesis
2. Physical Modelling of Musical Instruments - A collection of papers which describe various physical synthesis algorithms.
3. Digital Synthesis of Plucked-String and Drum Timbres - A simple software implementation of the Karplus Strong Algorithm
4. The BRASS Project, From Physical Models to Virtual Musical Instruments : Playability Issues - Discussions on various software implementations and their drawbacks.
