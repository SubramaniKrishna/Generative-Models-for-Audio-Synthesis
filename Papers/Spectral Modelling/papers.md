# Spectral Modeling Synthesis
The following is the list of papers. The bold ones are the ones reviewed by me which I recommend going through first.
1. **Musical Sound Modeling with Sinusoids plus Noise** - Prof. Xavier's Paper describing the techniques of spectral modeling
2. **A System for Sound Analysis/Transformation/Synthesis based on a Deterministic + Stochastic Decomposition** - Prof. Xavier's PhD thesis
3. Spectral Modeling Synthesis: Past and Present - Prof. Xavier's slides, discussing potential ideas to work on in SMS
4. **Higher level spectral processing** - Discussions on interesting transformations
5. Toward the Perfect Audio Morph? Singing Voice Synthesis and Processing - Describing + comparison techniques for synthesis of singing voice
6. **Musical Instrument Sound Morphing Guided by Perceptually Motivated Features**
7. **Spectral Envelope Estimation and Representation for Sound Analysisâ€“Synthesis**
8. **AUTOMATIC TIMBRAL MORPHING OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENT SOUNDS BY HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTORS**
9. **Perceptual evaluations of synthesized musical instrument tones**
10. **Creating Music by Listening**
11. Perceptual Synthesis Engine: An Audio-Driven Timbre Generator
12. **AUTOMATIC AUDIO MORPHING**
13. Perceptual scaling of synthesized musical timbres: Common dimensions, specificities, and latent subject classes
14. Multidimensional perceptual scaling of musical timbres(JM Grey's original work on MDS)
