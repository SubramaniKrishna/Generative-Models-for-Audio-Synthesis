# Generative Models for Audio Synthesis

Hi!  
This repository is an introduction to various synthesis methods. It starts with Physical and Spectral Modeling Synthesis, and then moves on to analyze current work in Generative Modeling(can be thought of as a comprehensive literature survey/review). It contains the following folders:

	1. Papers - A comprehensive list of papers in the three areas mentioned above, along with the papers themselves(annotated by me). The papers that I have found interesting are highlighted. 
	2. Codes - Supporting Notebooks which contain a set of Ipython Notebooks which contain a brief summary(written by me) of the papers read above.

There are also some text files which contain interesting links and other observations by me in general.   
If you find anything interesting, or want to share your thoughts/comments/feedback, please mail me at subramani.krishna97@gmail.com.
